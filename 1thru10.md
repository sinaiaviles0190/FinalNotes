# Final Notes 

## Chapter 01 Cloud Concepts
Infrastructure: the components that make up IT, for example physical components like harware. Can also include software and networks.

Development: the process of creating a software. Steps include determining needs, designing, testing, fixing bugs, etc.

Security: Process of keeping designed software (networks, data, etc.) safe from hackers.

Data: Both hardware and software fall under Data. Hardware like HDD and SSD's store data, software is what accesses the data. Forms of data include Word Documents, photos, etc.
Learning the basic components of a computer are necessary in order to understand Cloud computing. Some components are not required in cloud like motherboard or basic input/output information. Since cloud is a virtual computer, it is important to be knowledgable on CPU's, RAM, Storage and GPU's.

## Chapter 02 Cloud Econ and Billing
Compute: charged per hr

Storage: charged per GB

Data transfer: outbound data has a charge, inbound data does not.

PAY AS YOU GO!! pay only for what you use. 

TCO : Total Cost of Ownership is the financial estimate and cost expense for your business.

Server, Network and Storage costs are somethings to take into consideration. AWS provides a TCO calculator. 

## Chapter 03 Global Infrastructure
AWS Regions are regions where infrastructure is held. The closer you are to a region, the faster the service will be.

AZ is the building that makes up the AWS Region. Having multiple AZ's is beneficial, gives you more back up options just in case an instance fails and you have more resources to use.

Scalability and elastic: can adjust to changes in capacity requirements, much room for growth

Fault tolerant: ability to continue operating even with failed components

Compute: supports big data processing and research examples: EC2, EC2 Scaling, Elastic Container and Elastic Registry

Storage: scalable, secure, reliable examples: Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Server), Elastic Block Store, Elastic File System

Databases: use cases and provide speed, reliability, availibility examples: Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS), Amazon Aurora, Amazon Redshift

Networking: preformance, global coverage, manageability, availibility examples: Amazon Private Cloud (VPC), Elastic Load Banding, CloudFront, Tranist Gateway
